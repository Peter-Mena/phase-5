Q1: Whatâ€™s the difference between ' ' and " " in shell?
Single quotes: Preserve literal value, no variable expansion or command substitution
Double quotes: : Allow variables and commands to be expanded.

Q2: Explain [ -f filename ] vs [ -d dirname ].
-f filename: Checks if a file exists and is a regular file
-d dirname: Checks if a directory exists

Q3: Explain stdout/stderr redirection, appending vs overwrite. How can you confirm redirection using file descriptors?
stdout: Standard Output, FD 1
stderr: Standard Error, FD 2
> file : redirect the output and overwrite on the file
>> file: redirect the output and append to the file
2> file : redirect the error and overwrite on the file
2>> file: redirect the error and append to the file
we can confirm stdout/stderr redirection by:
/proc/<PID>/fd/

Q4: Show an example of a for loop in bash. Then, write a simple bash calculator that does add/subtract.
for loop:
for file in *.txt; do   echo "Found text file: $file"; done
calculator:
we create a script calc.sh 
nano calc.sh 

#!/bin/bash

# Simple calculator: add or subtract

echo "Simple Calculator"
echo "Enter first number:"
read num1

echo "Enter second number:"
read num2

echo "Enter operation (+ or -):"
read op

case $op in
  "+")
    result=$((num1 + num2))
    ;;
  "-")
    result=$((num1 - num2))
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Error: Invalid operation. Use + or -"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

echo "Result: $result"
then chmod +x calc.sh
then ./calc.sh
